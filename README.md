# Hi, I'm Alfi Syahri 👋

Software Engineering student at Gorontalo State University.  
I build practical software, mostly backend-oriented, and I like understanding how systems work under the hood.

## 🚀 What I'm working on

- **Jokiwi**  
  A simple task / joki manager web app built to manage real-world “joki tugas” workflows.  
  Focused on task tracking, client–worker separation, pricing, status management, and basic coordination flow in one place.

- **WhatsApp Bot (fork & experiments)**  
  Exploring automation and bot logic using existing open-source bases.

- **Small tools & experiments**  
  Python scripts, backend utilities, and random experiments to learn new concepts.
